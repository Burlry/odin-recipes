    <h4>Key Ingredient</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>instant ramen noodles</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Optional Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>eggs</li>
        <li>aromatics (green onions, garlic, ginger)</li>
        <li>broth (vegetable, coconut, curry, beef, chicken, etc.)</li>
        <li>protein (pork, beef, spam, tofu, etc.)</li>
        <li>sauces (sriracha, oyster sauce, fish sauce, hoisin sauce etc.)</li>
        <li>vegetables (whatever you have on hand, be creative!)</li>
        <li>toppers (sesame seeds, furikake, cilatro, peanuts etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Instructions</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>In a pan start cooking your protein of choice with a tablespoon of a neutral oil. After the protein starts to get some color add your vegetables to the pan as well. Make sure the protein is fully cooked and the vegetables are slightly tender before removing from the heat.</li>
        <li>Now let's start by cooking our aromatics. Put a tablespoon of a neutral oil in your pot and saute the green onion whites, garlic, and ginger for about 1 minute. Once they smell fragrant and delicious put in your broth of choice.</li>
        <li>As the water comes to a boil place one or two eggs into the pot and set a timer for 3 minutes. We're actually going to cook the eggs for 6 total minutes but at the 3 minute mark we'll put in our instant noodles.</li>
        <li>When the timer goes off, add your noodles to the pot and restart the 3 minute timer. Once it goes off we can transfer our ramen to our serving bowl. Take the eggs and run them under cold water before peeling and adding back to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Add your sauces of choice to the bowl to give it some spice, some umami, or some sweetness.</li>
        <li>Finally we can add our vegetables and protein back to the bowl, as well as any toppers we prepared, along with our green onion greens.</li>
    </ol>   
        
    <p>This recipe will completely change your view on instant ramen and help you clean out your fridge at the same time!</p>
